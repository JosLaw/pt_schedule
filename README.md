# **PT Weekly Diary**

This is a terminal based app for a fictional PT business. The app will allow users to make a booking for that week. Data for the bookings and current clients are held on an external Google Worksheet.

## **Design**
The website uses a colour pallette generated by [Coolors](ref 6). This gives a simplistic yet clean appearence to the app. The app content has been centralised to make the terminal the focal point of the viewport.
An external Google Worksheet containing ficticious data was created. The worksheet consists of two sheets. One contains a client list. The other contains a weekly calender, with days of the week as columns, and timeslots as rows.
The purpose of the app is to access the data contained within the worksheet in order to update it based on user iteraction, as well as read and interpret the data following user input/requests.
The logic for the app functions were mapped out on a logic map. You can find the logic map for the original concept here: [logic](assets/images/logic-map.png)

## Future Updates

* Background image relevent to concept/business type
* A more in depth menu function for better user interaction and experience

## **Features**

### **Header**

The header large and central above the terminal to display app name. Basic colour of black to provide contrast to background colour and make it stand out. Slightly translucent background around header for contrast from background image Imported font called Aoboshi One used.

### **Button**

The button is central above the terminal in a bright colour, with black text. On hover the background and text change to more muted colours to signify user interaction.

### **Terminal**

The terminal has been placed in the center of the page, to make it the main focal point.

* Laptop on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers
* Apple laptop on Google Chrome

| Test  | Result | Fix |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Username validation. Use special characters or numbers  | Value error raised  | No fix required |
| Client check. Use existing username to see if matched to sheet  | Name found and Welcome message printed  |
|

## **Deployment**
The project was deployed to Heroku. The steps below explain the process.

 - In the Settings tab of the named app, connect it to relevent Github repository
 - Scroll down to 'Buildpacks' and add python. Add a second buildpack for nodejs
 - Scroll up and click on the Deploy tab
 - There are 2 options for deployment, auto or manual. Ensure main is selected for deploy branch.
 - Click Enable Automatic deploys if you want the app to update after every push to Github
 - For manual deployment click 'Deploy Branch'. This will have to be done after every push to Github to update the live app.

Forking the GitHub Repository makes a copy of the original repository on the GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository. The steps below explain the process

 - Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
 - At the top of the Repository just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button
 - You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

Use the below steps to make a Local Clone

 - Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
 - Under the repository name, click "Clone or download"
 - To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link
 - Open Git Bash
 - Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
 - Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3
 - Press Enter. Your local clone will be created
